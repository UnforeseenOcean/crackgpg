After I lost the passphrase for my PGP key I searched for tools that could "recover" the lost passphrase. 
My first attempts were *rephrase* and *nasty*. Because the didn't scale very well (they run one one CPU core only) I started this project.

Usage
-----
*crackgpg* does read the passphrases from stdin so it can be combined with any wordlist generator like *crunch* (I did write my own wordlist generator which implements a subset of crunch, see [jcrunch](https://github.com/pfichtner/jcrunch))
*crackgpg* supports the estimation of lines generated by crunch/jcrunch (which are printed out on stderr), so pipe stdout and stderr to *crackgpg*

```
java jcrunch-0.0.1-shaded.jar -l 1 -h 3 2>&1 | java -jar crackgpg-0.0.1.one-jar.jar
```

Performance
-----------
* On my laptop *nasty* did 500 keys/s
* *crackgpg* did 2,000 keys/s on a single core(!)
* using four cores *crackgpg* did 3,000 keys/s
* and on a 24 core machine using 22 cores *crackgpg* did 20,500 keys/s

State of knowledge
------------------
Although with more than 20,000 keys/s it takes months or years to crack the passphrase using brute force mechanisms.
